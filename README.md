This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It uses key events to listen for the letters that players will type. If the word is madonna, it is displayed like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _. As the user guesses the correct letters, they are revealed like so: m a d o _  _ a. The player is shown the number of guesses remaining and letters already guessed. After the user wins/loses the game automatically chooses another word and makes the user play it.
